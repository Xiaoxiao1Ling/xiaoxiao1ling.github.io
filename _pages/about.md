I am a postdoc researcher in health economics based at [Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/groups-and-centres/health-economics-research), University of Oxford. Previously, I did my PhD at the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-statistical-science), University College London, under the supervision of [Prof Gianluca Baio](https://gianluca.statistica.it) and [Dr Andrea Gabrio](https://sites.google.com/site/agabriostats/home). My research broadly focusses on health economic evaluations and their associated statistical methodologies.
