I am a postdoc researcher in health economics based at [Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/groups-and-centres/health-economics-research), University of Oxford. My current work focusses on trial-based economic evaluations and observational data analysis for orthopaedic interventions and sleep disorders. 

Previously, I did my PhD at the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-statistical-science), University College London, under the supervision of [Prof Gianluca Baio](https://gianluca.statistica.it) and [Dr Andrea Gabrio](https://sites.google.com/site/agabriostats/home). 

Broadly, my research interest includes:
+ Health economic evaluations
+ Missing data
+ Bayesian methods in health economics
+ Causal inference

[Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Using Individual-Level Data is Sensitive to the Choice of Uniform Priors on the Standard Deviations for Costs in Log-Normal Models](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-025-01511-1?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20250812&utm_content=10.1007%2Fs40273-025-01511-1).** ***PhamarcoEconomics***. 

We found that Bayesian cost-effectiveness analyses are sensitive to the choice of the Uniform prior distributions on log cost standard deviations when costs data are assumed to be log-normally distributed and contain zero values. <br>

We identified 87 trial-based CEAs, and found that complete case analysis or available case analysis (CCA/ACA) and multiple imputation (MI) were the most popular methods to handle missing costs and QoL in base-case analysis. However, CCA/ACA dominated sensitivity analysis. Missing costs were widely imputed at item level via MI, while missing QoL was usually imputed at the more aggregated time point level during the follow-up via MI.<br>
