I am a postdoc researcher in health economics based at [Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/groups-and-centres/health-economics-research), University of Oxford. My current work focusses on trial-based economic evaluations and observational data analysis for orthopaedic interventions and sleep disorders. Broadly, my research interest lies in health economic evaluations and their statistical methodologies, with a particular focus on handling missing data and applying Bayesian methods in health economics.

Previously, I did my PhD at the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-statistical-science), University College London, under the supervision of [Prof Gianluca Baio](https://gianluca.statistica.it) and [Dr Andrea Gabrio](https://sites.google.com/site/agabriostats/home). 

I look forward to collaborating with researchers who share an interest in health economics and its statistical methodology.

Ling, X., Gabrio, A., & Baio, G. (2025). Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis using individual-level data is sensitive to the choice of Uniform priors on the standard deviations for costs in Log-Normal models. *PhamarcoEconomics*.(Accepted) 

> We found that Bayesian cost-effectiveness analyses are sensitive to the choice of the Uniform prior distributions on log cost standard deviations when costs data are assumed to be log-normally distributed and contain zero values.
